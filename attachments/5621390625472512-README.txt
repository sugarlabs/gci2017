The color scheme is in rainbow gradient, which when the user hovers their cursor over the icon it will turn into the darker color.

This will encourage the user to complete all task to view the homepage in full color and of course, it will look more colorful and appealing when all of them are done, instead of a single color.

The journal at the bottom of user's avatar will be in black doesn't matter user has used it or not to prevent confusion with the activity (I guess the journal is not the 'real' activity but is where you record your progress, right?).

This scheme might cause the loss of identity, however, as long as the avatar, comment, and link, are in the identity color, nothing will affect much.

I have included the preview .JPEG file with color palette and how it will look like when 1.completed 2.uncompleted and 3.hovering. However please note that the icon in the preview file is a bit different because I cannot find any editable SVG file from the site's source (I found the file, but it's not editable).
