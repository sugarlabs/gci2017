Difficulties:
	Step 0:
		Tried 8 times to download sugarizer-dev.zip. Failed 7 times due to network error.
		Not sure where to type 'cd sugarizer-dev'
		The line 'chrome --allow-file-access-from-files index.html' gives error: 'chrome is not recognisable ...', when the line is typed in the command prompt.
	Step 1:
		Index.html only shows toolbar after changing the three files as stated in step 1 tutorial. Cleared browser cache and solved it (following mentor's instruction).
	Step 2:
		Pawn color not changed even though it is supposed to change. Cause: overlook ';' in '&fill_color;' and '&stroke_color;'
	Step 3:
		Cannot get user name from currentenv due to launching Pawn.activity/index.html directly without launching Sugarizer/index.html first.
	Step 4:
		Pawn colour not changed even though it is suppose to change colour to follow user's colour. (Caused by mistake in step 2)
	Step 5:
		-
	Step 6:
		In the setting for network, user name or password is sometimes invalid, but I don't understand how it is invalid.
	
	
	
Parts that need more clarification:
	Step 0:
		Should state clearer where to type the command lines and how to change the command lines to work on the user's computer (Command Prompt, etc.)
		For example, for the 'cd sugarizer-dev' command line, you state that this line navigates to the sugarizer-dev directory. But this line does not work on all computer because the directory differs from computer to computer. You should include a link to a website which shows how to navigate to a desired directory in command prompt.
		Similarly, you should state that 'chrome --allow-file-access-from-files index.html' only works in the folder where the chrome application is in, and index.html may need to be replaced by the path to index.html, such as something like "file:///C:/Users/Username/Downloads/sugarizer-dev/index.html".
	Step 1:
		Should state how to edit the contents in .info and .html files, e.g. using notepad ++.
		Should state clearer where to find activities.json of the Sugarizer, for example 'inside Sugarizer folder, but outside the subfolders'.
	Step 2:
		Should state clearer where to create icons directory. You state that create it in 'your activity', but there are two activities: Pawn.activity and Pawn.activity/Activity, so "your activity" is vague.
		Typo at last line: "Congratulation! the welcome message will no appear". The 'no' should be 'now'.
		In the line "Then we will replace raw colors value #xxxxxx in the SVG file, by reference to &fill_color; and &stroke_color;.", it may be good to highlight the semicolons after &fill_color and &stroke_color as some user (like me) may overlook it. It may also help to state that all original color values associated with fill_color and stroke_color need to be replace.
	Step 3:
		-
	Step 4:
		You may want to state that the popup menu on Paint icon takes a while to appear. Initially, I thought that it doesn't work as it does not show when my cursor stays on the icon for a while.
	Step 5:
		Should state how to create locale.ini, e.g. using notepad++, and possibly provide a link to download notepad++.
		The line "So we will now initialize the welcome message in the localized event listener like that, at the end of activity/activity.js file:" is not clear. The 'end of activity/activity.js file' is vague. Is it after define, after require, or in the end of require?
	Step 6:
		The line "This palette must be initialized in the code. You just have to call the PresencePalette constructor with the toolbar element. So add this line into activity/activity.js:" is not clear. Which part of activity.js should I add the line into? You should be more specific, e.g. 'into the end of the require of activity/activity.js' or 'after <some code>'.
