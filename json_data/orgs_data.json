We try to focus our efforts on lesser-resourced and marginalised languages, but also work with more widely-spoken languages. The platform provides,\n\n# a language-independent machine translation engine\n#  tools to manage the linguistic data necessary to build a machine translation system for a given language pair and\n# linguistic data for a growing number of language pairs.\n\nIt is being developed around the world, in universities and companies and by independent free-software developers. There are currently 42 published language pairs within the project (including a number of \"firsts\" — for example Aragonese—Spanish, Crimean Tatar—Turkish, Spanish—Occitan, Breton—French, Italian—Sardinian among others), and several more in development.",

The main differences are that our Pocket Code app runs on Android phones, can take advantage of all your phone’s sensors, high-resolution multi-touch screen, and supports advanced computer vision, speech recognition, and augmented reality. Catrobat also has a powerful physics game engine, making the programming of Angry Birds like games unbelievably easy. Wireless extensions to Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Lego Mindstorms robots, and Chromecast devices make Pocket Code an immediate success both among total beginners as well as seasoned developers who want to leisurely create awesome 2D and 2.5D games and other apps while on the go, anywhere, and at any time. We are also actively developing an iOS version of Pocket Code, which currently however is still a closed beta on iTunes. \n\nAll programs created with our apps can be shared with an international community of users, in particular with your friends and family. You can publish your apps under a free open source license, thereby helping others to learn coding apps, fostering the spirit of openness, and giving you the chance to tap into the creativity of all our users.\n\nCatrobat is a free open source “meta” project, enabling you and hundred thousands of other users to create free open source apps!",

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning etc. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis.",

    "description": "# Why Terasology\n\nWe set out to see how an open source and super extensible voxel game inspired by Minecraft could go beyond it, aiming for gameplay like seen in Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper. What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n# Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible. It even excludes such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release, and fully replaceable.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability. Other JVM languages can be added too.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single console command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\n\u2028The software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and the various [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.",

    "description": "Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or at companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, audible notifications, missed-message emails, desktop apps, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.\r\n\r\nUnlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 350 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a web version, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.\r\n\r\nZulip is known for its extensive developer documentation (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is a great project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.\r\n\r\nWe have tons of tasks across all parts of the Zulip project, and we're especially excited about expanding Zulip's library of bots and integrations!",
